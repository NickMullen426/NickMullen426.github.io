# Question 2 - Inaccurate scraping and Loss functions

Although I have found that the vast majority of the time, a python ddg scrape will return appropriate results, running the code interp.plot_top_losses(20, nrows=9) will show the data with the largest loss. I have found that 
although the model is not perfect there are certain instances where the scrape function did not find an appropriately labelled animal, an example of which is below in the image of an 'elephant'.

I found that FastAi automatically allocates the loss function used for the model. It does this without user input by identifying the intended task and data type. In the multi-class image identification program run on 
question two, a CrossEntropyLoss function is used.
