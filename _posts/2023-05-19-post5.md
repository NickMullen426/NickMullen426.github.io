# Question 3 issues

I believe I have been able to create a program that is able to solve question two. 
There are a few complications I have found while programming a solution to question 3. Fortunately the program that was constructed for question two can 
largely be used for question three. Using a number of different pre-trained image classificaiton models, starting with resnet18 for efficiency then progressing 
to resnet152 and densenet201, I was able to get good results with an accuracy of approximately ~95%. The complication lies in the apparent threshold held there.
I began experimenting with changing a number of different parameters from random cropping parameters to image augmentation to increasing epochs and found that 
the 95% accuracy theshold  could not be passed. Currently the given training and testing data sets are allocated to 80% and 20% of all images respectively. 
I may need to start altering the allocated distributions perhaps to 90/10 to find if that can improve accuracy.
