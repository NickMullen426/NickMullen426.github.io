# AI Research 

It was interesting to note that kaggle put on a competition in 2020 with a prize pool of $1,000,000 for deepfake detection. A 'deepfake' in this case is a video 
with facial or voice manipulation. The competition has long since ended but the winner was a man named  Selim Seferbekov whose model accuracy was roughly 65%. 
This should demonstrate how difficult it made be to create a detection solution to fraudulent media constructed through AI.

The link to the now ended competition is provided below:
