# Testing conclusions

After having changed the resize parameter from 32 to 224, the accuracy successfully improved past the ~95% threshold and reached close to 98%. It then unfortunate 
then that google colab prevented me from GPU acceleration for the last day or so as more testing with a 224x224 size would have been beneficial and the project is 
due at 4pm. I am glad however, seeing as this is my first time experimenting with code in the field of AI, that I was able to improve on the model over time through 
learning. I conclude this project having an accuracy of ~98% on the validation set.
