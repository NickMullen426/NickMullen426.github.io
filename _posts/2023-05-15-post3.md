# Understanding codespaces & colab

I have more time than I care to admit in attempt to understand the differences between codespaces and colab and why the use of the two concurrently is justified, 
as well as the subtle coding differences needed between the two. Besides the obvious difference in that a GPU can be utilised on colab which will speed up machine
learning considerably, google colab is a cloud based jupyter notebook environement with many pre-installed packages while codespaces uses docker containers to provide
a consistent development environment. 

I was also confused as to why when I pushed changes to a repository, those changes were not present in the relevant codespace. It is my understanding now that a 
codespace should be treated similarly to an independent computer in which those changes will need to be pulled to the codespace local repo. This was necessary
to understand as VSCode offers an export to PDF system that is needed for this assignment.
