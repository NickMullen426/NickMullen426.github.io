# Cleaning Data

It has been mentioned by multiple AI teachers that cleaning data in practice will take the majority of your time during a project. Fortunately then, 
the data for question three has already been 'cleaned' in that all images are assumed to be labelled correctly and no data is corrupted. This is not the case
for the data in question two, since the data is scraped from the duckduckgo API. When running the ImageClassifierCleaner() function, a helpful GUI will appear that
showcases some of the images with the highest loss function. Even without cleaning the data, the model was able to get to an accuracy of ~97.5% so time was spent on
question three in an attempt to improve accuracy there. However the results of the cleaner function made it obvious that image cleaning would very likely result in
a better accuracy as some images were clearly mislabelled, as shown below. 

## Apparently these are images of a 'bold eagle'

The "ImageClassifierCleaner()" function, although helpful, was not able to manipulate and change multiple classes at once and an attempt at running the function in 
an iterative process that cleaned data one class at a time returned errors. Since the dataset is not exceedingly large, unzipping the 'animal.zip' folder and 
manually cleaning data was done before re-zipping and then replacing the folder with the now cleaned 'animals.zip' for notebook use.
